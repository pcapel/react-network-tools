# react-network-tools
Declarative data providers using socket.io and axios for react applications.

## Usage
I use yarn, so [the docs](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/add/) are clear:

`yarn add https://github.rackspace.com/phil9824/react-network-tools.git`

 Should get you up and running.

 ## Why
Because I wanted to use these in more than one project, and copy-pasta is a
great way to have out of sync stuffs.  This is the easy road for the time being.
